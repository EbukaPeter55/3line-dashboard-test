 ## Important information:
 While I built an API for User role using Node and Express, I didn't deploy it to render because of time constraint at my work place. So I made use of a mock data locally for user roles

## Getting Started

To set up the project locally, ensure you have Node.js v22 and pnpm installed. Then, follow these steps:

1.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    pnpm install
    ```
2.  **Run the development server:**
    ```bash
    pnpm dev
    ```
3.  **Run the unit tests using:**
    ```bash
    pnpm test
Ensure you create a .watchmanconfig in the project root before running the command for unit test
